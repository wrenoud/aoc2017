These are my answers to the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/). I am posting them well after the top 100 are already filled because of my timezone.

## Setting up enviornment

If you want to play with my repo you just need [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/). You can set this up with [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) and start the server as below:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
activate aoc
python -m notebook
```
